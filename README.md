## About Me

I’m currently a data science student at the Institute of Technology of Cambodia.  
I enjoy working on projects that help people, solve real-world problems, and encourage responsible use of AI and data.

Throughout my journey, I’ve had the opportunity to explore different areas such as machine learning, dashboard creation, and real-time systems. I’m always open to learning, improving, and collaborating with others.
