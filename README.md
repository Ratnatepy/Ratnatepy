## 👩 About Me

I'm a curious and driven data science student from Cambodia 🇰🇭 who believes in the power of **data for good**. Whether it’s predicting student success, building real-time dashboards, or applying deep learning to public safety — I thrive on challenges that make a meaningful difference.

Throughout my journey, I’ve gained hands-on experience through internships, academic research, and hackathons — always balancing technical depth with empathy, ethics, and collaboration.
